/** Hereâ€™s your first exercise for this section. I want you to create an address object with three properties, street, city, and zip code 
using the object literal syntax. When you do that, then create a function called showAddress that takes an address object and displays all the 
properties of this object along with their value. */

/** So in the last exercise we used the object literal syntax to initialize an address object. In this exercise, I want you to initialize an address 
object, first using a factory function and then using a constructor function. So your exercise is to write two different functions, one is a factory 
function, the other is a constructor function, to initialize an address object.  */
