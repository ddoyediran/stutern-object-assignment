/// Exercise 3 ///

/** Question: 
In this exercise, we're going to use the constructor function that we created in the last exercise to create two address objects, address1 and address2. 
I want you to create two functions. One is called areEqual, so we pass two address objects and we check to see if these two objects are equal. 
Now as I told you before, objects are reference types, so we can have two objects with the exact same properties, but these objects are in different 
memory locations, so when we use the equality operator we're essentially checking to see if these objects have the same reference. Now, to properly 
check to see if two objects are equal, we need to check their properties, we need to make sure that all their properties are equal. So that's the job of 
this function areEqual. If all the properties of these two objects are equal, this function should return true, otherwise it should return false. 
Now the other function I want you to write is areSame. And this function simply tells us if address 1 and address 2 are pointed to the exact same object. 
In other words, they're referencing the same object. Go ahead and solve this.
*/

// using areEqual function "Does a shallow check"
// Helper function: to check if both objects has the same properties
// INPUT: takes 2 object parameters as input
// OUTPUT: returns true if they have same properties and false if otherwise
function areEqual(addressOne, addressTwo){
  // loop through both
  let addOneKeys = Object.keys(addressOne);
  let addTwoKeys = Object.keys(addressTwo);

  // first is to check if they have same length
  if(addOneKeys.length === addTwoKeys.length){
    for(let i = 0; i < addOneKeys.length; i++){
      if(addOneKeys[i] !== addTwoKeys[i]){
         return false
      }
    }
    
    // then they have same property
    return true
  }
  
  return false
  
}

const addressThree = new CreateAddress("Mo tower", "Abuja", 54321);
const addressFour = new CreateAddress("Molinear tower", "Lagos", 12345)

console.log(areEqual(addressThree, addressFour)) // true

addressThree["country"] = "Sweden"; // one more property is added
console.log(areEqual(addressThree, addressFour)) // false


// using areSame function
// Helper function: to check if both objects reference the same object
// INPUT: takes 2 object parameters as input
// OUTPUT: returns true if they reference same object and false if otherwise
function areSame(addressOne, addressTwo){
  if(addressOne === addressTwo){
    return true
  }
  
  return false;
}

console.log(areSame(addressThree, addressFour)) // false

const addressFive = addressThree

console.log(areSame(addressThree, addressFive)) // true
